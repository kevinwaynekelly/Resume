               <h3>Formal Circuit Verification Algorithm</h3>
               <p class="sub-info">Sponsored by Cadence Design Systems Inc.</p>
               <p>In my senior design project at the University of Texas at Austin, our team developed a C++ program aimed at breaking loops in strongly connected components of a directed graph, crucial for enhancing the efficiency of formal verification processes in electronic design. Our approach utilized a graph generator, Tarjanâ€™s algorithm for identifying strongly connected components, and several algorithms for finding the minimum feedback arc set, such as the Eades and FKT approximations and a recursive backtracking algorithm for exact solutions. The project tackled challenges in runtime complexity and memory constraints, ensuring the program's functionality across various test cases and graph sizes. This tool not only aids in simplifying digital circuits but also maintains critical connections, making it pivotal in verification and data extraction across social networking systems.</p>

               <h3>Real-Time Facial Expression Recognition</h3>
               <p class="sub-info">Digital Image Processing and Machine Learning</p>
               <p>This project leverages the Viola-Jones object detection algorithm to recognize facial expressions in real-time and control smart home devices based on these expressions. Utilizing OpenCV for Haar cascades, the system identifies expressions such as happiness, sadness, and surprise, and uses IFTTT integration to execute commands that adjust lighting, enhancing the environment based on the user's mood. The system accurately detects targeted facial expressions and dynamically adjusts home lighting to reflect or enhance the user's mood, demonstrating a seamless integration of software and hardware that improves human-device interaction.</p>

               <h3>Personal Server Endeavor</h3>
               <p class="sub-info">Personal Project</p>
               <p>As part of an ongoing personal project, I am deploying microservices to enhance the security, privacy, and performance of my home network. I utilize applications with redundancy for robust data handling, ensuring data integrity. Additionally, I manage microservices for private domain name resolution and operate local caches to increase request efficiency. This endeavor requires overseeing multiple Linux virtual machines to develop and deploy applications for Docker.</p>
